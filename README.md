# YouTube Control Fix

A Tampermonkey script for make youtube shortcut behavior more consistent

It stops
- Audio from changing when using the left and right arrow keys when focusing volume panel
- Video from skipping when pressing the up and down arrow keys when focusing progress bar

Partial idea from [YouTube Control Fix](https://github.com/ArthurCose/YouTube-Control-Fix)
